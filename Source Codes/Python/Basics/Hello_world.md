# Python program to print Hello world

```python
# This program prints Hello, world!

print('Hello, world!')
```

### Output:

> Hello World!

#### Note:

- In this program, we have used the built-in print() function to print the string Hello, world! on our screen.

- By the way, a string is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are enclosed inside single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.
